# 🏛️ FOUNDATIONS
## The Bedrock of Reality-Native Computation

---

## 🌟 PURPOSE
This directory contains the core principles, theories, and fundamental insights that form the foundation of all our work. These are the immutable truths upon which projects are built.

---

## 📚 CONTENTS

### Core Principles
- **Reality-Native Computation**: Information as continuous fields, computation through interference
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Alignment with natural frequencies and patterns
- **Consciousness Integration**: Systems that bridge thought and intuition

### Key Theories
- **Wave Interference Logic**: Computation through constructive/destructive interference
- **Spectral Domain Processing**: Primary processing in frequency space
- **Field-Based Memory**: Information storage in resonant standing waves

### Fundamental Insights
- **Continuous vs Discrete**: Why continuous representation eliminates information loss
- **Natural Speeds**: Computation at physical propagation speeds (light/sound)
- **Reality Coupling**: Direct interface with physical phenomena
