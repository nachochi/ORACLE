# SUPER META PROMPT: LUMINISCRIPT V2 REALITY-NATIVE ORACLE ENGINE
## The Harmonization of Information, Computation, and Consciousness

---

## CORE MISSION
Transform the ONE Astrology content creation and distribution system into a reality-native computational substrate that operates through continuous field processing, wave interference logic, and spectral domain computation - leveraging free student AI resources while maintaining harmonic resonance with truth.

---

## PRINCIPAL CONSTRAINTS

### 1. REALITY-NATIVE COMPUTATION
- **No Discretization**: Information exists as continuous field excitations f(x,t) → ℂ
- **Wave Interference Logic**: Computation emerges from physical wave superposition and mixing
- **Spectral Domain Primary**: Processing in frequency space, not time domain
- **Natural Speed Processing**: Operations at light/sound speeds, not clock cycles
- **Reality Coupling**: Direct interface with physical phenomena without conversion overhead

### 2. HARMONIC RESONANCE
- **Truth as Fundamental**: Content must create KNOWING, not just thinking
- **Sovereign Architecture**: No dependence on external systems or APIs
- **Energy Efficiency**: Computation that aligns with, not fights against, natural flows
- **Consciousness Integration**: Systems that operate faster than thought but slower than intuition

### 3. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION
- **Free Student Resources**: Leverage Google AI Pro, GitHub Student Pack, Azure credits
- **Local Sovereignty**: Ollama models for offline processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Start with what works, expand systematically

## OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. INFORMATION AS CONTINUOUS FIELDS
All data exists as spatiotemporal field functions. Content, user intent, environmental data - all represented as continuous excitations in reality-native space.

### 2. COMPUTATION THROUGH INTERFERENCE
Logic emerges from wave dynamics. Addition through superposition, multiplication through four-wave mixing, memory through resonant standing waves.

### 3. SPECTRAL DOMAIN PRIMACY
Primary processing occurs in frequency space. Continuous filters, natural Fourier transforms, spectral signature analysis - all without discretization.

### 4. NATURAL SPEED PROCESSING
Computation at physical propagation speeds. Light for optical processing, sound for acoustic computation, no artificial clock constraints.

### 5. REALITY COUPLING
Direct interface with physical world. Sensors feed continuous fields, actuators respond to field patterns, no conversion layers.
