# LUMINISCRIPT V2: REALITY-NATIVE ARCHITECTURE

## Revolutionary Computing Paradigm

LUMINISCRIPT V2 represents a fundamental shift from discrete digital computation to reality-native spectral processing. This architecture eliminates the artificial boundary between physical phenomena and computational representation by operating directly in the continuous spectral domain.

## Core Vision

**Information exists as continuous field excitations. Computation happens through physical wave interference. Processing occurs in the natural spectral domain without discretization.**

## Foundational Principles

1. **Continuous Field Representation**: Information encoded as continuous field amplitudes and phases
2. **Wave Interference Computation**: Logical operations through constructive/destructive interference
