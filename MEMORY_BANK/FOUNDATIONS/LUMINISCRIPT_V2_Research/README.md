# 🔬 LUMINISCRIPT V2 RESEARCH
## Reality-Native Computational Paradigm

---

## 🏛️ FOUNDATION STATUS
**COMPLETED RESEARCH** - Theoretical framework established, working implementations demonstrated, ready for practical application.

## 📚 KEY COMPONENTS

### 1. Continuous Field Processing
**File:** `continuous_field_processing/field_representation.py`
- Information represented as spatiotemporal field functions f(x,t) → ℂ
- Amplitude and phase encoding fundamental data

### 2. Wave Interference Computation
**File:** `interference_computation/wave_logic.py`
- Logic gates through constructive/destructive interference
- Arithmetic through nonlinear wave mixing (four-wave mixing)
- Memory through resonant standing wave patterns

### 3. Spectral Domain Processing
**File:** `spectral_processors/` (directory)
- Primary computation in frequency space, not time domain
- Continuous Fourier transforms through optical/photonic means
- Natural parallelism through wavelength division multiplexing

### 4. Reality-Native Coupling
