## 🧭 NAVIGATION PRINCIPLES

### The Minecraft Rule
**Every folder and file must have clear signage.** Each directory contains a `README.md` explaining:
- What this area contains
- Why it exists
- How to navigate further
- What you'll find inside
- Current status and next steps

### The Paper Trail
**Every evolution is documented.** When ideas move between folders or evolve into projects:
- Original files are preserved in ARCHIVES
- Evolution path is documented
- New implementations reference their foundations

### The Living System
**This is not static.** Files move, evolve, combine, and spawn new projects as insights deepen.
