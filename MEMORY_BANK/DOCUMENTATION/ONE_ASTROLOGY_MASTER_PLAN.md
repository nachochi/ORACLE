# PART II: VIDEO 001 PRODUCTION PLAN

## Phase 1: Pre-Production (Day 1)

### 1.1 Environment Setup (The Temple)
```
[ ] Clean command center area
[ ] Arrange monitors to display:
    - A natal chart (any chart)
    - A Bloch sphere diagram (Google Images)
    - Solar system orbital animation (YouTube loop)
[ ] Test lighting (backlit by monitors + one side key light)
[ ] Test audio (use phone voice memo or USB mic)
```

### 1.2 Script Finalization
The script is complete in `ONE_ASTROLOGY_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`. 

**Key Sections:**
- ACT I: The Signal (0:00 - 1:30) - "God speaks in Frequency"
- ACT II: The Physics (1:30 - 4:00) - Star in a Jar / Rotational Shear
- ACT III: The Horoscope (4:00 - 5:30) - Etymology chain (Scope → Isis)
- ACT IV: The Manifesto (5:30 - END) - Call to action

**Total Runtime Target:** 6-8 minutes

## Phase 2: Production (Day 1-2)

### 2.1 Recording Options (Choose ONE)

**OPTION A: Full Video Recording (Recommended)**
```
Equipment: Phone camera on tripod/stack of books
Position: Medium shot, you in chair, monitors behind
Lighting: Monitors provide backlight, add lamp from side
Audio: Phone's mic (quiet room) OR USB mic
Process:
1. Record full script in one take (or section by section)
2. Don't worry about mistakes - just keep going
3. Target: 10-15 min raw footage → edit to 6-8 min
```

**OPTION B: Audio-Only + AI Visuals**
```
Equipment: Phone voice memo
Process:
1. Record audio only in quiet room
2. Upload to Adobe Podcast Enhance (free) for cleanup
3. Use AI video generator (InVideo/Pictory) to add visuals
Pros: Faster, no camera anxiety
Cons: Less personal connection with audience
```

**OPTION C: Hybrid (Best of Both)**
```
1. Record a few "Command Center" shots (30 sec each)
   - You sitting, looking at screens
   - Close-up of your face, intense
   - Wide shot of the setup
2. Record audio separately (cleaner quality)
3. Combine in editor with AI-generated B-roll
```

### 2.2 B-Roll Sources (All Free/Low-Cost)

# PART VI: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

## 6.1 Planetary Frequencies (Verified via Cousto Method)

The frequencies are calculated by:
1. Take the orbital period in seconds
2. Calculate f = 1/T (frequency in Hz)
3. Double the frequency (raise by octaves) until in audible range

| BODY | ORBITAL PERIOD | BASE FREQ | OCTAVE RAISED | FINAL Hz | NOTE |
|------|----------------|-----------|---------------|----------|------|
| Sun (Earth Year) | 365.25 days | 3.169e-8 Hz | 32 octaves | 136.10 | C# |
| Moon (Synodic) | 29.53 days | 3.919e-7 Hz | 29 octaves | 210.42 | G# |
| Mercury | 87.97 days | 1.316e-7 Hz | 30 octaves | 141.27 | C#/D |
| Venus | 224.7 days | 5.154e-8 Hz | 32 octaves | 221.23 | A |
| Mars | 686.98 days | 1.685e-8 Hz | 33 octaves | 144.72 | D |
| Jupiter | 4332.6 days | 2.671e-9 Hz | 36 octaves | 183.58 | F# |
| Saturn | 10759.2 days | 1.075e-9 Hz | 37 octaves | 147.85 | D |

**Note:** The "Sun" frequency (126.22 Hz) used in our documents refers to the Earth-Sun relationship from a different calculation method (the Earth's orbital velocity). Both are valid depending on frame of reference.

## 6.2 Aspect Ratios as Wave Interference

| ASPECT | ANGLE | HARMONIC RATIO | MUSIC INTERVAL |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Conjunction | 0° | 1:1 | Unison |
| Sextile | 60° | 5:6 | Minor Third |
| Square | 90° | 3:4 | Perfect Fourth |
| Trine | 120° | 2:3 | Perfect Fifth |
| Opposition | 180° | 1:2 | Octave |

## 6.3 Recommended Tech Stack (Phase 2)

**Frontend:**
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Three.js / React Three Fiber
- Zustand (state management - simpler than Redux)
- Tone.js (audio/sonification)

**Ephemeris:**
- `astronomia` npm package (pure JS)
- OR Swiss Ephemeris via WebAssembly
- OR Astro.com API (if available)

**Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS
- Custom CSS variables for "Ancient Future" theme

# PART VII: BRAND IDENTITY GUIDELINES

## 7.1 The ONE Logo Concept

**Primary Mark:**
- Eclipse aesthetic (dark circle with golden corona)
- Clean, geometric
- Works on dark backgrounds

**Color Palette:**
| COLOR | HEX | USAGE |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Space Black | #0a0a0f | Primary background |
| Solar Gold | #ffd700 | Accents, highlights |
| Plasma Cyan | #00ffff | Secondary accent |
| Nebula Purple | #8b00ff | Tertiary accent |
| Bone White | #f5f5f0 | Text |

**Typography:**
- Headers: Space Grotesk, Orbitron, or similar geometric sans
- Body: Inter, IBM Plex Sans
- Avoid: Comic Sans, Papyrus, anything "mystical" looking

## 7.2 Tone of Voice

**DO:**
- Speak like a scientist explaining to a peer
- Use precise language
- Reference physics, mathematics, engineering
- Be direct and confident
- Allow dark humor / veteran directness

**DON'T:**
- Sound "new agey" or "woo woo"
- Use excessive qualifiers ("maybe", "possibly", "I think")
- Apologize for the content
- Oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy

## 7.3 Key Phrases (Brand Language)

| PHRASE | USAGE |
|--------|-------|
| "Star in a Jar" | The contained soul metaphor |
| "Rotational Shear" | The stabilizing force (aspects) |
| "Scope of Isis" | The UI/viewport |
| "Dissonance" | Error states, problems |
| "Sun Signature" | The complete chart frequency |
| "Cosmic Engineering" | What we do (not fortune telling) |
| "Fix the machine" | The call to action |

---

# PART VIII: RISK MITIGATION

## 8.1 IP Protection

**DO NOT REVEAL:**
- The ONE Sphere hardware concept
- Specific implementation details of "cold plasma computing"
- Any patent-pending technology

**SAFE TO SHARE:**
- The philosophical framework (Rotary Language)
- The etymological connections (Green Language)
- The visualization concept (3D astrolabe)
- The "Star in a Jar" metaphor

## 8.2 Potential Criticisms & Responses

| CRITICISM | RESPONSE |
|-----------|----------|
| "This isn't real science" | "I'm using physics metaphors to explain energetic principles. The math is real." |
| "Astrology is fake" | "I'm not predicting the future. I'm analyzing initial conditions." |
| "You're just making things up" | "Every correspondence I cite has historical/etymological backing." |
| "Santos Bonacci is [controversial]" | "I synthesize from many sources. I verify what resonates." |
