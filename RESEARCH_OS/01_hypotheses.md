# Hypotheses

## H1: Wave interference can implement logic
- Claim: Superposition and phase relationships can realize logic gate behavior.
- Observable: Output amplitude/phase thresholds map to boolean outputs.
- Testability: Simulate two input waves and measure output field energy.

## H2: Interference gates are stable under noise
- Claim: Small phase/amplitude noise does not flip outputs beyond tolerance.
- Observable: Output classification remains stable under defined noise.

## H3: Spectral-domain operations reduce information loss
- Claim: Frequency-domain processing preserves more signal structure.
- Observable: Compare reconstruction error after filtering vs time-domain.

## Notes
- Keep hypotheses falsifiable.
- Each hypothesis should map to one experiment with metrics.
